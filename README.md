EEET2481 - Assignment 3: Tetris Game (Nuvoton M480)

This project contains the source code for a classic Tetris game, designed to run on an embedded system using the Nuvoton M480 microcontroller (ARM Cortex-M4 series). The Graphical User Interface (GUI) is designed and powered by the emWin library.
📋 Introduction

This is the major assignment (Assignment 3) for the EEET2481 course. The application simulates the classic block-stacking game, featuring fully functional screens, game logic processing, and touch interaction.
Key Features:

    Welcome Screen: Greeting interface upon startup.

    Play Screen: The main game area displaying falling blocks, current score, and controls.

    Game Over Screen: Displays end-of-game notifications.

    High Score Screen: Saves and displays high scores.

    Graphical User Interface (GUI): Smooth interface built with emWin (AppWizard) featuring buttons and images.

    Controls: Supports interaction via Touchscreen.

🛠 System Requirements
Hardware

    Microcontroller: Nuvoton M480 Series (Specifically M487 or equivalent).

    Display: TFT LCD with Touch support (standard with Nuvoton development kits).

    Debugger/Programmer: Nu-Link (usually integrated on the NuMaker board).

Software

    IDE: Keil MDK (uVision 5 or higher).

    Libraries:

        Nuvoton Standard Driver (BSP).

        Segger emWin Graphics Library.

        CMSIS (Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard).

🚀 Setup and Build Instructions

    Environment Setup:

        Install Keil MDK.

        Install the Nuvoton NuMicro M480 Series Device Database package for Keil.

    Open Project:

        Launch Keil uVision.

        Go to Project -> Open Project...

        Select the A3_TETRISGAME.uvproj file in the root directory.

    Build:

        Press F7 or click the Build button on the toolbar to compile the source code.

        Ensure there are no errors (0 Errors) in the Build Output window.

    Flash:

        Connect the Nuvoton M480 board to your computer via USB (Nu-Link port).

        Press F8 or click the Download button to flash the code onto the microcontroller.

📝 Game Logic (Custom Code)

The core logic of the game is located in the Application/Source/CustomCode directory. Important files to note:

    ID_SCREEN_PLAY_Slots.c: This is where the main Tetris game processing happens.

        Drawing Tetrominoes (blocks).

        Collision detection.

        Button event handling (Move Left, Right, Rotate).

        Score calculation.

    ID_SCREEN_WELCOME_Slots.c: Handles the transition from the welcome screen to the gameplay screen.
